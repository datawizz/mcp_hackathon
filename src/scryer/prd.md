# Product Requirements Document: Category Theory-Based RDF Knowledge Engine

## Executive Summary

This PRD outlines the architecture and requirements for a category theory-based knowledge engine that seamlessly integrates with RDF triple stores. The system allows for sophisticated query mechanisms through predicate path composition and implements a dual representation approach where predicates have both a string representation and an executable Prolog term that evaluates against RDF patterns.

## Background

Traditional graph databases and RDF triple stores lack native support for high-level abstractions and compositional queries. By applying category theory principles, we can create a powerful abstraction layer that enables:

1. Path-based knowledge discovery
2. Compositional query patterns
3. Inferencing through morphism composition
4. File organization that mirrors logical structure

## Target Users

- Data scientists working with knowledge graphs
- Semantic web developers
- AI researchers building reasoning systems
- Enterprise knowledge management teams

## Core System Requirements

### 1. Double Category Model

The system shall implement a double category model where:

- Objects represent entity types (e.g., persons, companies, products)
- Morphisms represent predicates with dual representation:
  - String label for human-readable path expressions
  - Prolog term that evaluates against RDF patterns
- Paths represent compositions of morphisms

### 2. File System Integration

The system shall:

- Use a configurable root directory for RDF data
- Map category paths to file system paths
- Automatically create and manage directory structures
- Support relative paths within the root directory
- Implement path-based file operations (load, save, query)

### 3. Path Expression Language

The system shall provide a DCG-based parser for:

- Path expressions in dot notation (e.g., `person.works_at.located_in`)
- Path composition verification against the category model
- Translation between path expressions and file paths
- Evaluation of path expressions against RDF data

### 4. RDF Pattern Matching

The system shall implement a set of predefined RDF pattern matchers:

- Direct relationship patterns
- Inverse relationship patterns
- Property path patterns
- Transitive closure patterns
- Property value matching patterns
- Custom user-defined patterns

### 5. Path Generation and Validation

The system shall:

- Generate candidate paths between object types
- Validate paths against actual RDF data
- Find all valid paths up to a specified maximum length
- Rank paths by relevance or complexity

## API Requirements

### Core API

```prolog
% Category Definition
define_double_category(Name)
define_d_object(Category, ObjectId, Label)
define_d_morphism(Category, MorphismId, SourceObj, TargetObj, StringLabel, PrologTerm)

% Path Operations
parse_d_path(String, Path)
compose_d_path(Source, Target, Morphisms)
d_path_to_file_path(Path, FilePath)
evaluate_path(Path, Subject, Object, RDFGraph)

% Path Generation and Discovery
generate_paths(Source, Target, MaxLength, Paths)
find_valid_rdf_paths(Source, Target, MaxLength, RDFGraph, ValidPaths)
generate_type_paths(SourceType, TargetType, MaxLength, RDFGraph, ValidPaths)

% RDF Integration
load_ttl(RelPath)
save_ttl(RelPath)
init_rdf_db(RelPath)
```

### Pattern Matching API

```prolog
% Basic Patterns
rdf_direct_relation(Subject, Object, Predicate, RDFGraph)
rdf_inverse_relation(Subject, Object, Predicate, RDFGraph)
rdf_type_relation(Subject, Object, Predicate, RDFGraph)

% Complex Patterns
rdf_property_path(Subject, Object, [Predicates], RDFGraph)
rdf_transitive_relation(Subject, Object, Predicate, RDFGraph)
rdf_property_value(Subject, Object, prop_value(Prop, Value), RDFGraph)
rdf_pattern_match(Subject, Object, pattern(Pattern), RDFGraph)
```

### Query API

```prolog
execute_d_path_query(PathString, SubjectType, ObjectType, Results)
check_path_validity(Source, Target, Morphisms, RDFGraph)
```

## System Architecture

The system architecture consists of five main components:

1. **Category Model Manager**: Maintains the double category model, including objects, morphisms, and paths
2. **Path Expression Parser**: Implements the DCG for parsing and generating path expressions
3. **RDF Pattern Engine**: Provides the pattern matching capabilities against RDF data
4. **File System Integration**: Handles the mapping between logical paths and file system paths
5. **Query Execution Engine**: Manages the execution of path-based queries and path generation

## Data Flow

1. User defines a double category model with objects and morphisms
2. User creates or loads RDF data organized by paths
3. User expresses queries as path expressions
4. System parses path expressions into logical paths
5. System executes path queries by evaluating the Prolog terms for each morphism in the path
6. System returns results as subject-object pairs that satisfy the path

## Optimizations

1. **Indexed Path Lookup**: Implement indexing for faster path retrieval
2. **Path Caching**: Cache frequently used path evaluations
3. **Parallel Path Evaluation**: Evaluate multiple paths in parallel
4. **Lazy Path Generation**: Generate paths on-demand instead of all at once
5. **File Path Indexing**: Maintain an index of file paths for faster lookups

## Implementation Considerations

1. **Scalability**: The system should scale to handle large RDF datasets
2. **Extensibility**: Allow for easy addition of new pattern matchers
3. **Integration**: Provide connectors for popular RDF stores
4. **Performance**: Optimize for query execution speed
5. **Standards Compliance**: Ensure compatibility with RDF/SPARQL standards
